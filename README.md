# ChemVision

## NOTE: 
The entirety of this project has been migrated to Unity Cloud. 
I will try my best to reflect changes here once primary development is finished.

## About:
- VR chemistry learning simulation for use with the Meta Quest 3.
- Aids students in spatial learning about objects such as:
    1. Molecules
    2. Chemicals and chemical bonds
    3. Proteins  

## Team members:

- Jingru Zhang
