# ChemVision

## NOTE: 
The entirety of this project has been migrated to Unity Cloud. 
I will try my best to reflect changes here once primary development is finished.

- VR chemistry learning simulation for use with the Meta Quest 3.
- Aids students in spatial learning about objects such as:
    1. Molecules
    2. Chemicals and chemical bonds
    3. Proteins  

## Team members:

- Jingru Zhang
- Alexander McKinney
- Zachery Linscott (zweatshirt)

Originally spearheaded by Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUe) alumn Kaleb Cole.
Idea proposed by professor Michael Shaw at SIUe.

## Project Goal(s):

- Update this project to a working state again and improve it by:
    1. migrating from GoogleVR to Google Cardboard.
    2. potentially adding more functionality.
    3. adding AR functionality to create a 'museum' of 3D chemicals, moleules, and proteins.
