# ChemVision

- VR chemistry learning environment for classrooms.

## Team members:

- Jingru Zhang
- Alexander McKinney
- Zachery Linscott (zweatshirt)

Originally spearheaded by alumn Kaleb Cole.

## Project Goal:

- The goal of this project since the start has been to create an interactive VR learning environment for students.
This idea was proposed by professor Michael Shaw at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville
- Our goal is to update this project to a working state again and improve it by:
    1. potentially adding more functionality.
    2. adding AR functionality.
but improve upon it by changing from Google VR to Google Cardboard compatibility,
adding more features, and potentially switching to augmented reality.
